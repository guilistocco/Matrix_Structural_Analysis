Classes, methods and attributes used in matrix structural analysis, in python3

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/guilistocco/Matrix_Structural_Analysis/master)

Repository for development of Matrix_Structural_Analysis package.
Started on Jan, 2021.

Installation avaliable at [TestPypi](https://test.pypi.org/project/Matrix-Structural-Analysis/)
 
## Why this is an important project?
As an civil engineer student and a aspirant Data Scientist, my passions merge at the computational aproach seen on Matriz Structural Analysis. This kind of analysis takes advantage of the automated process only computers can achive and the effort method provided by resistance of materials theory. As result, this project seeks to help on solving problems using 2D Frames and Trusses using OOP principals.

## Libraries
* Pandas
* Numpy

## About the archives
Library to host all modules of the package. 

* Stiffiness Matrix.ipynb contains all classes loaded and examples/exercises usign them. The Jupyter Notebook helps to keep it easy to try out the tools.
* .gitignore contains archives that are not fundamental to this project
* MATRIX STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS – THE STIFFNESS METHOD contains .py files with modules used on the Matrix Structural Analysis method 
* LICENCE indicates the MIT license for this project
